# Application Link
Tweet Predictor

# Decription
This application predicts out of two users, which user is more likely to say a hypethetical tweet. It takes 100 tweets from both inputted users, vectorizes all 100 tweets, then uses co-sign similarity on the vectors to show which user was most likely to say the inputted tweet. The user with the highest percentage of cosign similarity will be selected as the output's user.

I taught myself Bootstrap and HTML in a week in order to create a more astetically pleasing application. Only a week before I was taught Flask, basic data structures & databases, and basic .py file knowledge.
